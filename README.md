To give a gist of what this is
    this is a socket wrapper that may not be needed
        this has a port finder via udp broad cast
            this is not perfect and may error which is why im working on it
                a sucessful version of this working is on my rock papper scisor it hub repo
                    the goal is to be as intuitiveas possible so feel free to make changes and push branches with eplanation
                        and yes this is for a local network 

My to do List
    add a better file transfer system
    make a server limit for automatic closure
    add a host and a client mode for less work on both ends
    make the object compilation better than curren as current adds way too much exraneous functions
    add an exapmle folder for easier use case and examples

Future Add - ons
  add pygame support
  add suport ot converse with other llanguages via sockets
  add the abilitt to open and acess sites for propper conversing with them
